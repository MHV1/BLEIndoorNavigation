Thesis project @ Turun Ammattikorkeakoulu.

This application is part of my bachelor’s thesis for the degree of IT engineering at Turun Ammattikorkeakoulu. Thesis document available at: http://theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/105619/Herrera%20Vargas_Milan.pdf?sequence=1

Work in progress… Stay tuned!

The app was presented as a prototype. Most of the features are functional but I’m still working on the UI and the overall performance. Some of the functionalities such as interaction with Google APIs where developed in a separate application which I’m planning to merge with this one.
